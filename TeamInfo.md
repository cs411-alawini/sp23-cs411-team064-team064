## Project Summary

We are creating the web application using the time performance 2015 data of domestic U.S. flights. The data contains information about each flightâ€™s airline, departure and destination airports, as well as whether the flight was on-time, delayed, canceled, or diverted. We are aiming to provide details to the users about the expected delay time, possible reasons for delay or cancellation and best days to travel to plan their trip accordingly.
